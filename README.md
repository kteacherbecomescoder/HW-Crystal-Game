# Crystal Collector Game Project

## Summary and Goals
The Crystal Collector is a web application that allows users to play a game where they gain points by clicking different crystals.  The goal is to match the presented score exactly without going over. This game is developed through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The Crystal Game is played by clicking different crystals that are randomly assigned a point value by the Math.random function in javascript. After each game, the crystals are dynamically created once again with different point values and new on click functions.
